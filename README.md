My first TOP Project Assignment - Cooking Recipes

In this project i implemented all of new acquired tools and knowledge from the TOP HTML curriculum.

The main improvement that i felt was to actually having to decide when and how to make the git commits, that part i felt was important to see it actually working.

Also i made a mistake when using the element "li"- list item. A simple way to remember this, is to associate the position of the l has the contrary of ul/ol (unordered list/ordered list)
