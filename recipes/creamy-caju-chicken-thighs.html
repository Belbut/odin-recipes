    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) and select Saute function. When the pot is hot, add 1 tablespoon butter and avocado oil to coat the bottom of the pot. Leave remaining 3 tablespoons butter out to soften.</li>
        <li>Place chicken thighs in the pot and sprinkle with basil and garlic powder. Brown for 3 minutes on each side. Temporarily remove chicken to a plate.        </li>
        <li>Pour broth into the pot and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off the bottom with a wooden spoon. Stir in garlic, Cajun seasoning, paprika, and cayenne. Return chicken to the pot and cancel the Saute setting.</li>
        <li>Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 6 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build. </li>
        <li>Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions for 5 minutes. Release remaining pressure carefully using the quick-release method, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid and remove chicken thighs to a plate.        </li>
        <li>Mix softened butter and flour together in a small bowl. Select Saute function and when the sauce begins to simmer, whisk in the butter-flour mixture until sauce has thickened. Cancel Saute function. </li>
        <li>Stir in heavy cream and roasted red peppers. Slice chicken thighs and return to the pot. Garnish with Parmesan cheese and basil leaves. </li>
    </ol>
